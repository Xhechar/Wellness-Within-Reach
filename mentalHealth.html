              I am, Janel Ann. I am a former college student from St. Jason
              Mathrix Technical Technology. Recently I got a job working as a
              mechanic engineer at my work place. It's good, but since the day i
              joined, I've been discriminated by other colleagues and co-workers
              because of my looks ðŸ˜žðŸ’”. I had an accident, immediately after my
              studies and the my face got burnt a little bit by the fire, i am
              always thankful to God for protecting me but i just don't even
              have the strength to go to work ðŸ˜­. I really need assistance ðŸ’”.

              Hey, Janel. I am Richard. I've also had the same scenario though i
              was at school. I found this place, Wellness-Within-Reach and the
              helped me deal with the discrimination. I had to believe in myself
              each and every-day and ignore all the people who were treating me
              badly and avoiding a lot of issues with them. It wasn't your fault
              getting to that position but just thank God for your life and
              ignore the people who don't see the good in you. You are special
